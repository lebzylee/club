    <h1 class="grow-fast">A Fast Growing Digital Community</h1>
    <p class="grow-p">As more people get to know about cryptocurrency and the potentials that lies therein, hence the need arises for an affordable yet sustainable strategy to be created to enable everyone benefit globally and grow. When you invite other members to join the club via your inviter's ID, they are joined with you as their inviter permanently in the system.
    </p>
<p class="grow-2">Becuase of the leverage index, network marketting over the years as a business model has proven to be the fastest and most lucrative industry where millonaires with little or no qualifications are created every year. In this connected and digital economy, Club-8 offers the platfrom for anyone to actively and passively earn & accumulate crypto from any part of the world. Because of the volatility of cryptocurrencies, many who are not knowledgeable about the authenticity of crypto projects and market fluctuations are discouraged from investing to avoid losses. To eradicate this challenge a stable coin BUSD is been used for this project.</p>
    <h6 class="grow-6">Your best bet is here with Club 8.</h6>

            Club-8 grants you the access to multiple streams of income by activating or belonging to a maximum to eight clubs which opens you up eight different streams of income that can be engaged separately. You and your friends can get started with as low as $20.
        </p>
        <p class="pa-5">
            Each of the eight clubs requires an activation cost bodly written on the club tag. After sign up, join higher clubs to increase your earning potentials. The cost of activating club 1 (registration) is $20. After registration, subsequent clubs can be activated.
        </p>
        <p class="pa-5">
            The cost of activating the next club is double the cost of activating the previous club. $20, $40, $80, $160, $320, $640, $1280 and $2560 respectively. Also profits from a club are also twice as high. With $5100, you can get to the peak with all the eight clubs activated.
        </p>
        <p class="pa-5">
            The clubs can only be activated serially (one by one) i.e you cannot activate a club without activating the previous club. You can activate as many clubs as possible immediately. The best place to be is club 8. Once a club is activated, it remains open forever as the clubs have no expiration date
